        <div><h2>About me</h2></div>
        <p> My name is Vladislav Galimzyanov. I’m 30 years old. I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, 
            if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore
            cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an 
            herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, 
            because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. 
            There is an idea of a Vladislav Galimzyanov. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, 
            and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.

        <p>Hey, thanks for reviewing my project. I know it's kinda of pain, so here some fun fact I learned while i was doing it: if you try to copy your nickname from Discord
           multiple times in a row, you will get a funny message! That's true! Just open your Discord, then click on your nickname in lower left corner. It will open a slightly
           bigger window, at it's top you will see your nickname. Click on it. There should appear a message which would say "Copied!". Wait until it dissapears and immediately
           click again. It now should say "Double copy!" Try to do this two more times :)</p>
        <p>If for some reason it doesn't work for you, <a href="img/Funny.png">here how this should look.</a></p>
